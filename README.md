Project Title: Rock Paper Scissors (rps)

Description:
The objective of our project is to successfully develop a rock paper scissors game. When completed, the user should be able to access a home screen with a start button and instructions on how to play the game. When start is pressed, the user can choose rock, paper, or scissors through image-based buttons on the left side of the screen. The server chooses a randomized response to the user’s input. With counters to keep score, the winner is decided after having won 2/3 rounds of the game, and is declared through a darkened screen, with a printed message that declares whether the user has won or lost. The user is able to restart the game by clicking on a restart button if they win, and their win will be counted to a streak counter. If they lose or press on the home screen button, then the streak counter is reset.

The user is able to restart the game by clicking on a restart button, or be able to access the home screen by pressing start. 

1. The game shall have a home screen that has a start button and an explanation on how to play rock paper scissors above the start button.  
2. Once start is pressed, the user will be lead to the game
3. There will be three image buttons for the game: rock, paper and scissors on the left side of the screen
4. The user will be able to select one of these buttons in order to input their decision
5. Once the user makes their decision, the computer’s button icons will pop up
6 The computer will make a decision, and the user will be moved to the next round 
7. Whoever wins the round will receive a point on their counter
8. This process will repeat until either the player or the computer wins two rounds of the game, and the winner is announced after three rounds
9. If the user wins, then they will be led to a screen declaring “You win!”, with an option to restart the game or continue to another game to keep their streak 
10. If the user loses, then they will be led to a screen declaring “You lose”, with an option to restart the game
11. When the restart button is pressed, then the game loops from the first round again
12. There is a streak counter throughout the game, which counts how many 3-round games that the user has won
13. If the user wins a three round game, then one is added to this streak counter. 
14. The user has an option every time they win the game whether or not to continue on with their streak with a continue button, or to restart the game and lose their streak. This means that they will have 2 options to either go back to the homescreen or to continue adding points to their streak counter.
