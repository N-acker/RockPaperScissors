Project Title: Rock Paper Scissors (rps)

Description: The objective of our project is to successfully develop a rock paper scissors game. When completed, the user should be able to access a home screen with a single player and multiplayer button, as well as instructions on how to play the game. When the single player button is pressed, the user can choose rock, paper, or scissors through image-based buttons on the left side of the screen. The server chooses a randomized response to the user’s input. When the multiplayer button is pressed, player one can choose rock, paper or scissors similarly to the single player option. Once a decision is made, the right side of the screen displays the same options with player 2 being able to make their decision. Both game options then lead to a screen announcing who won the first round, with an option to continue or return to the homescreen. With counters to keep score, the winner of the game is decided after having won 2/3 rounds of the game and is declared through a page with a printed message that declares the winner. The user(s) can restart the game by clicking on a next game button if they win, and their win will be counted to a streak counter. If the user(s) press on the home screen button, then the streak counter is reset. It is also reset when the user loses on single player mode. 

Project Requirements:

1.	The game shall have a home screen that includes single and multiplayer buttons, as well as instructions on how to play the game. 
2.	Once either game button is pressed, the user(s) will be led to the game
3.	There will be three image buttons for the game: rock, paper and scissors on the left side of the screen
4.	The user will be able to select one of these buttons in order to input their decision
5.	In the single player mode, once the user makes their decision, the second user’s button icons will pop up on the right side of the screen, and once their decision is made will be lead to a screen that announces who won the round
6.	In multiplayer mode, the computer will make a decision, and the user will be moved to a screen that announces who won the round
7.	In single player mode, the process will repeat until the player or the computer wins two rounds of the game, and the winner is announced after three rounds, adding a point to the winner’s counter and with a message announcing the winner
8.	In multiplayer mode, the process will repeat until the player or the second player wins two rounds of the game, and the winner is announced after three rounds, adding a point to the winner’s counter and with a message announcing the winner 
9.	In single player mode, the users will then decide whether they would like to play a new game to continue their streak (if they earned one), or to return to the homescreen 
10.	In multiplayer mode, If the user wins, then they will be led to a screen declaring “You win!”, with an option to restart the game or continue to another game to keep their streak
11.	When the homescreen button is pressed, then the user(s) is lead to the homescreen
12.	When the new game button is chosen, then then the game loops from the first round again with the added points from the streak counter
13.	There is a streak counter throughout the game, which counts how many 3-round games that the user has won
14.	If the user wins a three round game, then one is added to this streak counter.
15.	The user has an option every time they win the game whether or not to continue on with their streak with a continue button, or to restart the game and lose their streak. This means that they will have 2 options to either go back to the homescreen or to continue adding points to their streak counter.
