# rpsProject
The objective of our project is to successfully develop a rock paper scissors game. When completed, the user should be able to choose rock, paper, or scissors through image-based buttons, and have the server choose a randomized response to the userâ€™s input. With counters to keep score, the winner is decided after three rounds of the game, and is declared through a pop-up message. If the user loses, they are able to restart the game by clicking on a new game button. 

    What type of language do we use?

    What level of detail do we need?

    In what form should we document and present the requirements?
